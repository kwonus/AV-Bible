**AV-Bible ::** ***Privacy Policy:***<br/>
While AV-Bible reads data from the AppData/Digital-AV folder, it ONLY reads files that it first downloaded. On first execution, AV-Bible downloads the KJV files as compact encoded binaries from Digital-AV.org. It needs these files for search & display of the bible text. The only other access to your local system is to store and retrieve AV-Bible program settings. AV-Bible accesses no other files on the user's file-system. In short, AV-Bible does not invade your privacy, neither does it read any data that it it did not first write. In fact, AV-Bible never even records what you search on; and it certainly never sends any data to any servers. It runs entirely stealthily on your Windows desktop.
